## Technologies
This project is written in ***Python 3.8*** with the following libraries:

***OS Module*** -provides functions for creating and removing a directory (folder), fetching its contents, changing and identifying the current directory, etc.

***Request Module*** is a python module that you can use to send all kinds of HTTP requests. It is an easy-to-use library with a lot of features ranging from passing parameters in URLs to sending custom headers and SSL Verification.

***json*** -stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It is a lightweight data-interchange format that is used to store and exchange data. It is a language-independent format and is very easy to understand since it is self-describing in nature.

***Python-dotenv*** -reads key-value pairs from a .env file and can set them as environment variables.rom dotenv import load_dotenv.

***alpaca_trade_api*** -The Alpaca SDK will check the environment for a number of variables that can be used rather than hard-coding these into your scripts. Alternatively you could pass the credentials directly to the SDK instances.

***MCForecastTools*** A Monte Carlo simulation is a useful tool for predicting future results by calculating a formula multiple times with different random inputs.

***panda*** -a Python package that provides fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with "relational" or "labeled" data both easy and intuitive.

***numpy*** -is a general-purpose array-processing package. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, and tools for working with these arrays. It is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.

***matpoltlib*** -is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
